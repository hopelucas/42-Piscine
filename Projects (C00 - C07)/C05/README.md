# C05

## About

Carrying on from C04, this project continues to teach you about using mathematics in relation to strings.

### Core Concepts 
- Finding information within data
- Coding algebraic functions
- Div / Mod
- Iteration

### Advanced Concepts
- Using fibbonacci
- Square roots
- Calculating chance

## Recommended Stop Point

After EX05, you can pass this project. Stop here - difficulty jumps from core to advanced.

## Projects
- EX00 - create a program that generates iterative factorials
- EX01 - generate recursive factorials
- EX02 - generate iterative powers
- EX03 - generate recursive powers
- EX04 - generate the fibbonnacci sequence
- EX05 - find the square root of a given number
- EX06 - check if a number is a prime number
- EX07 - find the next prime number in a sequence
- EX08 - solve the ten queens puzzle
